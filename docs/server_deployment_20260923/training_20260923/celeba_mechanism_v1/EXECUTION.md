# Mechanism stage: handoff and execution

This stage is prepared and locally checked. No new real-image or GPU run has started. `prepared_acceptance.json` verifies the complete 800-new/100-reused grid, 18 image gates and two unchanged-worker references, the five frozen core/loader source files, and six CPU/synthetic component checks. It does not verify current server data, real images, GPU numerics or scientific outcomes.

Runtime files are `adapter.py`, `worker.py`, `runner.py`, `prepare.py` under the project-local `tmp/celeba_mechanism_20261009/`. A byte-identical deployment snapshot and setup archive accompany this entry. Preserve file bytes during transfer; remote paths in the manifest are POSIX. A draft Windows-path error was intercepted before launch, corrected and rechecked; see `predispatch_path_failure.json`.

Authorized target: `ssh -p 26712 root@213.224.31.105`, instance52514165. Before remote actions read `/etc/vast-agents-guide.md`, inspect actual GPU/process/resource state, and verify the repository and data. Never start the old server or previously completed queues.

Install runtime files at `/workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded/deployment/celeba_mechanism_20261009/` and the prepared stage contents at `/workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded/results/revision_20261009/celeba_mechanism_v1/`. Do not replace the frozen core. The three commands below are sequential, with inspection and acceptance at each boundary. They are instructions, not records of execution.

```bash
cd /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded
.venv/bin/python deployment/celeba_mechanism_20261009/runner.py preflight --repo /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded --stage /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded/results/revision_20261009/celeba_mechanism_v1
.venv/bin/python deployment/celeba_mechanism_20261009/runner.py freeze --repo /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded --stage /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded/results/revision_20261009/celeba_mechanism_v1
.venv/bin/python deployment/celeba_mechanism_20261009/runner.py run --repo /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded --stage /workspace/GuardFed-celeba-expanded/results/revision_20261009/celeba_mechanism_v1
```

The preflight queue executes only 20 three-round pipeline jobs: 18 intervention/distribution gates and two unchanged Full references. Formal dispatch needs all gates, exact Full same-horizon regression, the identities of all100 reused Full models/results, source/data/config consistency, no existing training worker and a separate frozen receipt. Eight independent processes use the established two-GPU/one-CPU-thread schedule; no tuning of ablation parameters occurs. Existing accepted outputs are checked before skipping. A failed or partial directory stops recovery; preserve and inspect it. There is no new midround-resume promise.

The runner and its source checks compile locally; the actual queue path remains untested on this currently unreachable server. In particular, live guide/lineage/real-image gates must pass before describing this stage as ready or running. If a legitimate identity or gate mismatch appears, preserve it and fix the deployment/control problem; do not weaken acceptance.

After training, still required: strict900-record merge, per-condition paired ten-seed tables, raw/native/shared-root-only calibration controls, incremental off-server model/result/log backups with member SHA and restore chain. No automatic test evaluation is included. The separate missing-baseline matrix and final evaluation remain outside this stage.
